His interest in orthopaedic surgery stemmed from his interest in athletics and his experiences as a patient. He attended The University of Toledo in Toledo, Ohio, for his undergraduate work as well as medical school. He completed his residency in orthopaedic surgery at Palmetto Health Richland in Columbia, South Carolina, earning Resident of the Year his final two years in training. Dr. Oros spent another year in the field of orthopaedic trauma at the R Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, Maryland.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:shortcode -->\n[read more]\n<!-- \/wp:shortcode -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>While taking care of complex trauma cases involving the pelvis and hip joint, he has taken a special interest in the treatment of hip disorders including preservation, reconstruction and replacement. Dr. Oros has dedicated a segment of his practice to the care of hip pain in the younger population using hip arthroscopy. Conditions such as labral tears, snapping hip disorders and femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) can be dealt with using this procedure. Access the online resources linked below to find out more about hip arthroscopy and the problems that can be treated with this procedure.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uosortho.com\/node\/15861\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Hip Arthroscopy<\/strong><\/a>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>For those patients whose problems extend beyond the help of an arthroscopic procedure, Dr. Oros offers the anterior approach to hip replacement. During this procedure, X-ray guidance is used to ensure the correct position of the replacement components, preventing issues relating to leg length or dislocation. This specific approach involves a smaller incision working around the muscles instead of through them, making recovery easier and faster.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Patient Educational Resources&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/orthoinfo.aaos.org\/topic.cfm?topic=A00572\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uosortho.com\/sites\/uosortho.com\/files\/Arthritis.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Arthritis Information\u202f(PDF)<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uosortho.com\/sites\/uosortho.com\/files\/Femoroacetabular-impingement-FAI.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Femoroacetabular Impingement \u2013 FAI\u202f(PDF)<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uosortho.com\/sites\/uosortho.com\/files\/whatishiparthroscopy.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Hip Arthroscopy \u2013 A Patient's Guide to Questions and Answers\u202f(PDF)<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uosortho.com\/sites\/uosortho.com\/files\/labral-tears.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Labral Tears\u202f(PDF)<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.uosortho.com\/sites\/uosortho.com\/files\/Snapping-hip-problems.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Snapping Hip Problems\u202f(PDF)<\/a>&nbsp;<\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr. Oros is married to Lisa Herron, M.D., a pediatrician practicing with Knoxville Pediatric Associates.

While at Campbell Clinic, he was chief resident from 1997-98.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:shortcode -->\n[read more]\n<!-- \/wp:shortcode -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr. McCollum specializes in adult reconstructive surgery, including total hip and total knee replacement.&nbsp;He practices at UT Medical Center and serves as the medical director for the Total Joint Program. He has a special interest in minimally invasive joint replacement techniques, such as&nbsp;anterior approach hip replacement, which is a muscle-sparing technique that is less invasive than alternative procedures and has a lower dislocation rate. Additionally, Dr. McCollum offers total knee replacement using state-of-the-art robotic arm assisted technology, which enables him&nbsp;to perform surgery with added precision.&nbsp;Patients who undergo an anterior hip replacement or a&nbsp;robotic assisted knee replacement&nbsp;generally can expect less post-operative pain and a faster recovery. The majority of patients are discharged without the need for inpatient rehabilitation following their hospital stay.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr. McCollum\u2019s Educational Links<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:list -->\n<ul><!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.utmedicalcenter.org\/jrc\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Total Joint Center at UT Medical Center<\/a><\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/orthoinfo.aaos.org\/topic.cfm?topic=a00377\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons \u2013 Total Hip Replacement<\/a><\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item -->\n\n<!-- wp:list-item -->\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/orthoinfo.aaos.org\/topic.cfm?topic=a00389\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons \u2013 Total Knee Replacement<\/a><\/li>\n<!-- \/wp:list-item --><\/ul>\n<!-- \/wp:list -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>A woodworker at heart, Dr. McCollum enjoys the mechanical aspect that carries over to his daily work in orthopaedics. For his young children, he constructed a playset rather than purchasing a kit with instructions, and this same passion for construction and precision carries over to his approach to reconstructive surgery. He enjoys the different challenges that each day brings and being able to contribute to the overall well-being of his patients while helping them move on with an improved quality of life following care. Dr. McCollum and his wife have four children.&nbsp;His personal interests include being active in Boy Scouts with his son and enjoying time in the Smokies hiking, kayaking and camping.<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:shortcode -->\n[\/read]\n<!-- \/wp:shortcode -->",

Johnson joined Knoxville Orthopaedic Clinic in 2013 after completing a sports medicine fellowship at the University of Kentucky. Originally from a farming community in central Kentucky, Dr. Johnson\u2019s perspective of medicine was shaped by the integrated community care provided by a small town family physician. His prior athletic endeavors, current recreational interests, and desire to help individuals maintain an active lifestyle led him to pursue a career in sports medicine.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:shortcode -->\n[read more]\n<!-- \/wp:shortcode -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr. Johnson has a varied sports medicine background within professional, collegiate, high school, and recreational settings. For three years he functioned as a team physician within the Cincinnati Reds organization for the Triple-A affiliate in Louisville (Bats) and served as a physician at spring training for the Reds in Goodyear, AZ. He has covered numerous Division I athletic events including Southeastern Conference and NCAA championship tournaments in multiple sports and has served as a team physician at the high school, collegiate, and professional levels. He has provided sideline and training room coverage for colleges at the Division I and Division II levels and previously served as a team physician for the University of Kentucky and Kentucky State University. He has also volunteered to provide medical coverage for local and national events including state athletic championships, marathons, rodeos, and the PGA tour. He currently serves as one of the team physicians for the Tennessee Smokies.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>As a fellowship-trained sports medicine physician, Dr. Johnson is able to treat any injury involving bones, joints, muscles, and tendons. This includes diagnosing and treating common and complex musculoskeletal injuries.

He has a strong interest in concussion management with formal training in the management of traumatic brain injuries through his physical medicine and rehabilitation residency and subsequent ImPACT CIC certification for neurocognitive testing. His true passion, however, is found in the treatment of throwing athletes and the shoulder and elbow injuries they can suffer. Dr. Johnson enjoys seeing individuals of all ages and levels of athletic or recreational activity.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<!-- \/wp:paragraph -->\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p>Dr. Johnson met his wife Kelly during their undergraduate studies at the University of Kentucky.

The Johnsons are engaged members of First Baptist Concord. Dr. Johnson enjoys coaching his children on the ball field and traveling with his family.

This begins by carefully listening to my patients as they describe the details of their particular ailments and understanding how these issues interfere with and limit their quality of life. Patient education is an important aspect of my practice philosophy. Medicine has become&nbsp;increasingly specialized and can often be very complex with the advent of more novel treatment options. In my experience, an informed patient who is well educated regarding their particular diagnosis is much more engaged and empowered throughout their treatment process.
